# Homework 1

Instructions:
- Modify the `Exercises/Problems.lean` file to solve the exercises.
- Make sure to specify your name (your project won't build otherwise).
- You may create new files, but don't modify any existing ones.
- You can see your progress with `lake build`.
- To submit the exercise, just commit and push. (You can do this
  multiple times.)
- You can look at the web version of the repository to check
  that your changes are correct, and that the GitHub action
  succeeded.

Note that the assignment will fail to build when you clone it.
You need to fill in your name in the problems file to fix this.
